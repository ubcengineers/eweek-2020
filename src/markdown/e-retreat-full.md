# E-Retreat

After two fun-filled weeks of on-campus activities, it’s off to the woods we go! This weekend gives you the chance to really bond with your peers, hear stories about the years of EUS past, and find out how to get involved! 

From September 13-15 we’ll be on Gambier Island at Camp Latona for the ultimate student-only weekend. You can hang out or follow along with our organized events! Here’s some of the things E-Retreat will have to offer:
Ropes courses
True Engineer
Kayaking
Swimming
Board and Card Games
Bonfires
Gambier Island Murder Mystery
Tankings
Shameless Pride in Engineering
The traditional hike!

**ARE YOU EXCITED?** Don’t worry, we know you are. We have a limited amount of spots available, so be sure to get your tickets ASAP!

A link to buy tickets will be up August 14th. A limited number of early bird tickets will be up for grabs first. Beat the rush!
