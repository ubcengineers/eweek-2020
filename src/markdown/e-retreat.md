# E-Retreat: a fun-dense weekend with your new pals

At the end of two weeks of fun on campus, we go on retreat! Probably the best part of being a first year — seriously. 2-days-2-nights of students-only fun. Take some time to hang out, as well as participate in organized events!

Come with an open mind and it’ll be the experience of a lifetime. Bond with new friends, hear stories from the older students (the volunteers), and learn more about how to get involved. E-Retreat 2019 will be located on Gambier Island, at Camp Latona!
